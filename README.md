Ben's Dotfiles and Aliases
==========================

Just in case my computer decides to pull a Roswell, New Mexico or Independence Day, I'm storing my `.bash_profile` here on Github.

Feel free to fork, clone, steal, whatever.

## Notes and prerequisites

This setup is meant for macOS and requires a couple of handy utilities that can be installed via `brew`.

You'll need these homebrew utilities

```sh
brew install jq
brew install thefuck
brew install python3
brew install gti
```

There are other utilities that I use, like `Sublime Text` (my personal editor of choice at the time of this writing), and `git-bash-completion` which can be found at [This link here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Basics-Tips-and-Tricks)

The full `git-bash-completion` script can be found [here](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash).

Other tools (non-homebrew)

* Sublime Text 3
* nvm
* rbenv
* Docker
* Anaconda
* Pip

Have fun! If you have other cool stuff you'd like to share, or find a typo (most likely). I'm open to PRs.

## zsh

If you're on MacOS Catalina or newer, make sure you install [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) before swapping out the `.zshrc` file here. You'll still need all the same homebrew tooling as well
